# Multi-Layer-Perceptron

This repository fully implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using basic Python operations. It's built from the ground up without relying on existing frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. Additionally, there's an implementation of the Wavenet architecture included here. Like the MLP, it's also developed using basic Python operations, showcasing its functionality and structure.
